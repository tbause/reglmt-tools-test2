## Language metadata table prototype

This is LMT demo  page works as follows:

1. Loads the LMT into the browser dynamically as xml from a known location
2. Repeat with the  xslt style sheet from a known location
3. Apply the transform to the XML and display the results in a an element called `rendering`
